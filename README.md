# shylock

The shylock project helps LSD Cloud admins to better understand how cloud resources are used. This analysis includes the amount of resources used by each user (virtual CPUs and block storage) as well as the CPU utilization.

We plan to evolve the shylock project from a bunch of data collection scripts to a web service that periodic collects the cloud usage data and show them in a more user-friendly fashion.
